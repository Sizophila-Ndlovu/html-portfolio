<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a passionate Develper who aspires to create valuable software.</p>

<p>I went to study Computer Science at Wits University, but could not finish my studies becasue of some math major module. My passion
  for programming remained even when I was no longer enrolled. Dare I say the passion grew larger and my hunger for solving problems using software 
  also grew.
</p>

<p>Currently I'm building my personal big Project. A Project of Web Development projects, which I will use to teach my siblings how to code. 
  I am structuring the projects within my Project by increasing programming complexity. I hope to leave little to no gaps in the lessons
   the projetcs will provide to my siblings.
